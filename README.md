## TOY ASSEMBLER AND SIMULATOR

to start program open ``index.html`` with live server

Then you see website and in this website you can add YOT program and assemble it or simulate assemled program

in ``top`` of website you will see this :
<br />
![Alt top bar](https://github.com/anedaaee/Toy_Processor_Simulator_and_Asembler/blob/main/assets/img/Screenshot%20from%202023-07-20%2017-11-42.png)
<br />

you can click on ``assemble`` or ``simulate`` to go to their ``section`` or you can easily ``scroll`` down.

in assemble section you will see this page
<br />

<br />

so you can upload your ``TOY program`` text file.

here is an example of ``fibonacci`` program

I have to mention you this tips:

1.your ``labels`` should start with ``.``
2.data must be between ``[0,2^16)``
3.address org must be betweem ``[0 , 4096]``
4.you can't use two variable with ``same`` name
5.you should use ``START`` before fist instructure
6.you should use ``FINISH`` before fist instructure
7.lines cant be ``empty``

after write your program you can click on ``upload file`` then select your file and upload it.
then web site show results in table or compile error
<br />

<br />
then you can ``download`` it by clicking on download link and ``code.txt`` will be download and its a file like this:
<br />
![Alt assembled file](https://github.com/anedaaee/Toy_Processor_Simulator_and_Asembler/blob/main/assets/img/Screenshot%20from%202023-07-20%2017-14-34.png)
<br />

after all you can upload the file in simulate section:
<br />
![Alt simulate section](https://github.com/anedaaee/Toy_Processor_Simulator_and_Asembler/blob/main/assets/img/Screenshot%20from%202023-07-20%2017-12-11.png)
<br />

then it will simulate you machin code line by line and show result in table:
<br />

<br />

i hope it be useful for you
